# Claude Notes - Application Initialization

## Current Status: Step 2 - Planning MVP Implementation

**IMPORTANT**: If starting from a fresh session, reread the project:init-app command file for full context.

### Application: Real-time Multiplayer 2D City Game
- **Core concept**: Procedurally generated 2D city where up to 10 friends can run around in real-time
- **MVP features**: Username spawning, health bar, basic movement controls
- **Target users**: Friend groups wanting to explore together
- **Key user flow**: Join with username → spawn in city → move around with WASD/arrows

### Completed:
- Set up task tracking system
- Created claude-notes.md file
- Gathered requirements from user
- Removed template line from CLAUDE.md

### Current Step:
- Planning MVP implementation

### Next Steps:
1. Plan MVP architecture (Convex for real-time player state, Canvas/SVG for 2D rendering)
2. Remove demo content but keep auth structure
3. Implement player spawning with username
4. Add health bar UI
5. Implement movement controls and real-time sync

### Commits Made:
- (None yet - first commit after planning)

### Key Context:
- Real-time multiplayer requires Convex subscriptions for player positions
- 2D rendering can use HTML5 Canvas or SVG
- Need player state management (position, health, username)
- Movement will be WASD or arrow keys
